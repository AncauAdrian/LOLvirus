DISCLAIMER: This program is not really a virus, it was made as a joke to mess with some friends, all in good fun.

This program checks if the League of Legends game client is working (meaning a game has been started), if yes, then the programs waits for a random amount of time between 5 and 15 minutes. After the set amount of time has lapsed it sends random input to the mouse pointer, causing random movements of the moue cursor and pressing some random keys from time to time to mess with the player, effectively making the game unplayable. 

This program enables persistency by editing the registry and adding itself to the startup programs, so it will start whenever the operating system starts.
